# Build 450

- The only supported game is Minetest 5.7.0.

# Build 537

- Remade all "base" textures (including touch screen controls);
- Updated "default_sand.png";
- Moved "character.png" from "base" to "minetest_game";
- Created changes.md, and readme.md now counts as a file.

# Build 537.1

- Copper blocks, ingots, lumps and ores from "minetest_game/default" now look different from iron/steel nodes/items.

# Build 538

- Updated Grass, Dry Grass (proposed by erlehmann from ContentDB), Papyrus and progress bar (which had a ~~skill~~ scaling issue on both PC and Android);
- Removed "wieldhand.png" from "base" (because it was overwriting "wieldhand.png" from "minetest_game");
- Added "icon.png" and "header.png" in "minetest_game" (to compensate for the removal of "wieldhand.png" from "base").
